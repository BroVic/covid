# covid

This repository houses code for downloading and displaying data on COVID-19. 

The data, as well as inspiration, are derived from the website of the [European Centre for Disease Control's COVID-19](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide). An initial script, which preceded this repository can be seen in [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/BroVic/32eca9d3ae3334bfe573e4aecb35c522) - note that it differs significantly from the similarly named file in this repository being standalone code.

The central feature of this project is the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app which can be viewed at <http:/victorordu.shinyapps.io/covid>.

Pull requests are welcome.
